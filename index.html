        <h4>Solutions</h4>
        <p>DriveMate is offering a web application that connects two types of users: car owners (CarCaptains) and drivers with a valid driving license (DriveCaptains) who want to make the same trip at a specific time.

          <br><br><br> This provides a solution for commuters and people who have lost their license due to revocation or illness.

          <br><br><br> DriveMate also allows you to choose the "vill√©giature" experience for people who want to have their car in another city without having to move the car themselves.</p>

        <h4>Originality</h4>
        <p>DriveMate connects the supply (CarCaptain) and demand (DriveCaptain) in an original way to meet one of the fundamental needs of real life: to move easily, to be independent and feel free.


          <br><br><br> DriveMate sets itself apart from other carpooling services with its unique features and commitment to making trips more efficient, enjoyable, and solidary for everyone.
